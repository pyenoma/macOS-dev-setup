# Introduction
Modified oh-my-zsh theme

# How to use?

## Pre-requisite
- oh-my-zsh should be installed.

## Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy the [theme file](af-magic-modified.zsh-theme) to `$ZSH/themes` directory (This is how a custom theme is installed in oh-my-zsh).
3. Edit `~/.zshrc` and set `ZSH_THEME="af-magic-modified"`.
4. Edit `~/.zshrc` and add `zmodload zsh/datetime` at the top. (This is needed for proper datetime calculations by the theme.)
